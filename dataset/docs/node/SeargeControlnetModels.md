- `SeargeControlnetModels`: The SeargeControlnetModels node is designed to facilitate the selection and application of various controlnet models within a generative AI pipeline. It abstracts the complexity of choosing and integrating different controlnet models, which are essential for modifying or enhancing generated content based on specific control parameters or conditions.
    - Parameters:
        - `clip_vision`: Specifies the CLIP vision model to be used, potentially including a 'none' option to indicate no specific CLIP vision model is required. This input is crucial for determining the visual understanding context for the controlnet model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `canny_checkpoint`: Refers to the specific checkpoint for the Canny edge detection model within the controlnet framework, including a 'none' option. It's used to apply edge detection features to the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `depth_checkpoint`: Indicates the checkpoint for the depth estimation model, allowing for depth-aware modifications to the generated content. This parameter includes a 'none' option to skip depth processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `recolor_checkpoint`: Specifies the checkpoint for the recoloring model, enabling color adjustments or transformations in the generated content. Includes a 'none' option for cases where recoloring is not required. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sketch_checkpoint`: Denotes the checkpoint for the sketch model, used to apply sketch-like effects or transformations to the generated content. A 'none' option is included for flexibility. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `custom_checkpoint`: Allows for the specification of a custom controlnet model checkpoint, providing additional flexibility in content modification. Includes a 'none' option. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `data`: Optional stream of data that can be used for additional processing or as part of the controlnet model's input. This parameter provides flexibility in handling complex workflows. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: The output data stream resulting from the application of the controlnet models, encapsulating all modifications and enhancements made to the generated content. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
