- `DifferenceChecker`: The DifferenceChecker node is designed to compute the absolute difference between two images, scaled by a specified multiplier. This functionality is useful for highlighting differences or changes between two images, which can be applied in various image processing and analysis tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `multiplier`: A scaling factor applied to the computed differences, allowing for adjustment of the difference intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images1`: The first set of images to compare. This input is crucial for determining the baseline for comparison. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images2`: The second set of images to compare against the first set. This input is essential for identifying the differences from the baseline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image or a set of images representing the scaled absolute difference between the input images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
