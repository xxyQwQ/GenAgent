- `Image Blending Mode`: This node is designed to blend two images together using a variety of blending modes. It allows for the creation of composite images by applying different mathematical operations to the pixel values of the input images based on the selected mode.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the blending mode to be used for combining the two images. Each mode applies a different mathematical operation, affecting the visual outcome of the blend. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `blend_percentage`: Determines the intensity of the blend between the two images. A higher percentage results in a stronger influence of the second image on the final output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image_a`: The first input image to be blended. It serves as the base layer in the blending operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_b`: The second input image to be blended. It is combined with the first image according to the specified blending mode. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The result of blending the two input images according to the specified mode and blend percentage. It represents the composite image generated by the blending operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
