- `JWImageFlip`: The JWImageFlip node is designed to flip images either horizontally or vertically based on the specified direction. This operation is fundamental in image processing tasks where orientation adjustments are necessary.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image tensor to be flipped. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the output by determining which image is subjected to the flipping operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `direction`: Specifies the direction of the flip, either 'horizontal' or 'vertical'. This parameter dictates how the image will be manipulated, affecting the final orientation of the output image. Type should be `['horizontal', 'vertical']`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The flipped image tensor. This output is the direct result of applying the specified flip operation on the input image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
