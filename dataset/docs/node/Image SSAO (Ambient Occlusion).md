- `Image SSAO (Ambient Occlusion)`: This node specializes in enhancing the realism of images by simulating the way light interacts with objects in a scene, particularly in areas where objects block ambient light, creating soft shadows known as ambient occlusion. It processes images and depth information to add depth and dimensionality, improving visual quality and realism.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: Controls the intensity of the ambient occlusion effect. Higher values result in more pronounced shadows, adding greater depth and contrast to the scene. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `radius`: Determines the spread of the ambient occlusion effect. A larger radius simulates a softer, more diffuse shadow, contributing to a more natural and realistic appearance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ao_blur`: Applies a Gaussian blur to the ambient occlusion effect, softening the shadows and blending them more seamlessly into the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `specular_threshold`: Sets the threshold for specular highlights. This parameter helps in distinguishing between surfaces that are directly lit and those that are not, affecting the application of ambient occlusion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `enable_specular_masking`: A boolean flag that, when enabled, applies a mask to the specular highlights, preventing ambient occlusion from affecting highly reflective surfaces. This adds to the realism by ensuring that shiny surfaces retain their characteristic brightness. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `tile_size`: Determines the processing mode based on its value, affecting the quality and speed of the ambient occlusion effect generation. Smaller values lead to higher quality but slower processing. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: A collection of images to be processed for ambient occlusion effects. These images serve as the base for the occlusion calculations, determining where shadows and highlights are added to enhance depth and realism. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `depth_images`: Corresponding depth images for each image in the 'images' list. These depth maps are crucial for calculating how light interacts with the objects in the scene, influencing the generation of ambient occlusion effects. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `composited_images`: The final images with the ambient occlusion effect applied, showcasing enhanced depth and realism. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ssao_images`: The generated ambient occlusion maps, indicating where shadows have been added to the scene. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `specular_mask_images`: Specular masks generated during the process, used to preserve the brightness of reflective surfaces by excluding them from the ambient occlusion effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
