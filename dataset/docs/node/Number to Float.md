- `Number to Float`: This node is designed to convert a given number into its floating-point representation. It abstracts the process of type conversion, ensuring that numerical inputs are seamlessly transformed into floats, facilitating operations that require floating-point precision.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `number`: The 'number' input is the numerical value that is to be converted into a floating-point representation. This input is crucial as it directly influences the output by determining the exact floating-point value that will be produced. Type should be `NUMBER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The output is the floating-point representation of the input number. This is significant for operations or calculations that require floating-point precision. Type should be `FLOAT`.
