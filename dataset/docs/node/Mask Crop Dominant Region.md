- `Mask Crop Dominant Region`: This node is designed to identify and extract the dominant region from a given set of masks, applying a specified padding around the cropped area. It leverages image processing techniques to focus on the most significant part of the image, enhancing the relevance of the extracted region.
    - Parameters:
        - `padding`: Specifies the padding to be applied around the cropped dominant region, allowing for adjustable margins around the extracted area. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `masks`: The input masks from which the dominant region is to be cropped. It plays a crucial role in determining the area of interest within the image. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MASKS`: The output consists of the cropped dominant regions from the input masks, potentially with applied padding. Type should be `MASK`.
