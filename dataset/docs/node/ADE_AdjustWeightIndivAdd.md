- `ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAdd`: This node is designed to adjust individual attention and positional encoding weights by addition, allowing for fine-tuned control over the animation diffusion process. It facilitates the customization of the animation generation by modifying the weights associated with different components of the attention mechanism.
    - Parameters:
        - `pe_ADD`: Specifies the addition value for positional encoding weights, influencing the spatial aspect of generated animations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_ADD`: Determines the addition value for the overall attention weights, affecting the focus and relevance of elements within the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `other_ADD`: Applies an addition adjustment to other unspecified weights, offering a generic mechanism for weight modification. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `print_adjustment`: Controls whether the adjustments made are printed out, aiding in debugging and fine-tuning processes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_weight_adjust`: Allows for the chaining of weight adjustments by taking a previous adjustment group as input, enabling cumulative adjustments. Type should be `WEIGHT_ADJUST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `weight_adjust`: Returns an updated weight adjustment group, encapsulating all the specified additions to the weights. Type should be `WEIGHT_ADJUST`.
