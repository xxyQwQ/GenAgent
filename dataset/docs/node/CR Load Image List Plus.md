- `CR Load Image List Plus`: The CR Load Image List Plus node is designed to load a list of images from a specified directory, along with additional information such as masks, indexes, filenames, and EXIF data. It aims to provide a comprehensive set of data for each image, facilitating advanced image processing and manipulation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_folder`: Specifies the directory from which images are to be loaded. It plays a crucial role in determining the source of the images and ensuring they are accessible for processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_index`: Determines the starting point within the list of images to begin loading, allowing for selective processing of images based on their order in the directory. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_images`: Limits the number of images to be loaded from the directory, enabling control over the volume of data processed at one time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `input_path`: An optional path to a specific directory or file from which images are to be loaded, providing an alternative to the default input folder. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: A list of loaded images, each converted to a tensor format suitable for further processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `MASK`: A list of masks associated with the loaded images, providing additional data for image manipulation tasks. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `index`: A list of indexes corresponding to the loaded images, offering a reference for image identification and ordering. Type should be `INT`.
        - `filename`: A list of filenames for the loaded images, aiding in tracking and referencing the images. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `width`: The width of the loaded images, providing dimensional data for processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the loaded images, providing dimensional data for processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `list_length`: The total number of images loaded, offering insight into the dataset size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `show_help`: A link to the help documentation for the node, offering additional information and guidance. Type should be `STRING`.
