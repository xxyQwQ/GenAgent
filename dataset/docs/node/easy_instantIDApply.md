- `easy instantIDApply`: This node facilitates the application of InstantID technology, integrating it with other models and processes within a pipeline to enhance identity verification and analysis capabilities. It leverages InstantID and InsightFace models, along with control network configurations, to process images for identity-related tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `instantid_file`: Specifies the file path for the InstantID model, essential for loading and applying the model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `insightface`: Indicates the InsightFace model to be used, enhancing the identity verification process with facial recognition capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `control_net_name`: Specifies the control network name to be used in the process, affecting the application of InstantID. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `cn_strength`: Determines the strength of the control network's influence on the process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cn_soft_weights`: Adjusts the soft weights for the control network, influencing its impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight`: Sets the overall weight of the InstantID application in the pipeline. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point of the InstantID application within the pipeline. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Specifies the endpoint of the InstantID application within the pipeline. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise`: Controls the level of noise to be considered in the InstantID process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline configuration and state, serving as the foundation for applying InstantID technology. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The image to be processed, acting as the primary input for identity verification and analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_kps`: Optional keypoints in the image, used for more precise identity verification. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: Optional mask to be applied on the image, used for focusing or excluding specific areas. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `control_net`: Optional control network settings, providing additional control over the InstantID application. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated pipeline configuration after applying InstantID, reflecting changes in the processing state. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The modified model incorporating InstantID features, ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: A positive outcome or feature extracted during the InstantID application, potentially used for further analysis. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: A negative outcome or feature extracted during the InstantID application, potentially used for identifying discrepancies or errors. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
