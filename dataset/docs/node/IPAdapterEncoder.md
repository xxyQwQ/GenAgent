- `IPAdapterEncoder`: The IPAdapterEncoder node is designed to encode images with specific adaptations, leveraging additional parameters such as weight and mask to fine-tune the encoding process. It aims to enhance image processing tasks by integrating clip vision capabilities and custom adaptations.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: A weight factor that influences the encoding process, allowing for fine-tuning of the adaptation effects on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `ipadapter`: Represents the IPAdapter instance to be used for encoding, determining the specific adaptation techniques applied to the image. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `image`: The image to be encoded, serving as the primary input for the adaptation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask that can be applied to the image, enabling selective encoding of certain image regions. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `clip_vision`: An optional parameter to incorporate clip vision features into the encoding, enhancing the adaptation with vision-based insights. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pos_embed`: The positive embedding result of the encoding process. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embed`: The negative embedding result of the encoding process. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
