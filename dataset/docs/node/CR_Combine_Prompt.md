        - `part3`: The third part of the prompt to be combined. It follows the second part, further extending the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `part4`: The fourth and final part of the prompt to be combined. It concludes the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `separator`: The string used to separate each part of the prompt in the final concatenated output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `prompt`: The final concatenated string resulting from combining the specified parts with the separator. Type should be `STRING`.
