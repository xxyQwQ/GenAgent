- `JWMaskLikeImageSize`: This node generates a mask of the same size as the input image, filled with a specified value. It's useful for creating uniform masks that match the dimensions of a given image.
    - Parameters:
        - `value`: A float value used to fill the generated mask, allowing for customization of the mask's intensity or transparency. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image tensor whose dimensions are used to determine the size of the generated mask. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output is a mask tensor of the same size as the input image, filled with the specified value. Type should be `MASK`.
