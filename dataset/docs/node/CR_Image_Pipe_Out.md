- `CR Image Pipe Out`: The CR_ImagePipeOut node is designed for extracting and outputting image data and its associated parameters from a pipeline. It facilitates the retrieval of image properties such as dimensions and upscale factor, along with providing a help link for further guidance.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The 'pipe' parameter is a pipeline input that carries image data and its associated parameters such as width, height, and upscale factor. It is essential for the node's operation as it determines the image and its properties to be outputted. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the original pipeline input, allowing for further processing or extraction of image data and parameters. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: Outputs the image data extracted from the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `width`: Outputs the width of the image extracted from the pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Outputs the height of the image extracted from the pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_factor`: Outputs the upscale factor associated with the image extracted from the pipeline. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a link to a help page for further guidance on using the CR_ImagePipeOut node. Type should be `STRING`.
