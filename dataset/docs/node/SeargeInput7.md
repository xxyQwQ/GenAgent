- `SeargeInput7`: SeargeInput7 is designed to process miscellaneous parameters for a user interface, specifically handling inputs like 'lora_strength', 'operation_mode', and 'prompt_style'. It combines these inputs, optionally with additional parameters, to configure and customize the operation of a system or application.
    - Parameters:
        - `lora_strength`: Specifies the strength of the LoRA (Long Range) parameter, affecting the intensity or effect of an operation within the system. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `operation_mode`: Defines the mode of operation for the system, allowing users to select from predefined modes to tailor the system's behavior. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `prompt_style`: Determines the style of prompts used within the system, enabling customization of user interactions or outputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs`: Optional additional parameters provided by the user, which are merged with the primary inputs to further customize the system's operation. Type should be `PARAMETER_INPUTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `inputs`: A comprehensive set of parameters, including 'lora_strength', 'operation_mode', and 'prompt_style', along with any additional inputs, configured for system operation. Type should be `PARAMETER_INPUTS`.
