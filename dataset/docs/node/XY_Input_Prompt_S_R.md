        - `search_txt`: The text string to be searched for within the prompt, serving as the basis for the replacement operation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `replace_count`: Indicates the number of times the search text should be replaced, affecting the extent of modification. Type should be `INT`.
        - `replace_i`: Dynamic inputs representing the replacement text for each occurrence of the search text, allowing for varied modifications across multiple instances. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
