- `easy XYPlot`: The `easyXYPlot` node is designed to facilitate the creation and manipulation of XY plots, particularly in the context of visualizing and analyzing data points or conditions across two dimensions. It supports advanced features such as handling positive and negative conditions, integrating with control networks for specific adjustments, and customizing plot dynamics based on user-defined variables.
    - Parameters:
        - `grid_spacing`: Specifies the spacing between grid lines in the XY plot, affecting the plot's granularity and readability. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_individuals`: Determines whether individual data points should be outputted separately, allowing for detailed analysis of each point. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `flip_xy`: Controls whether the X and Y axes should be flipped, altering the plot's orientation and perspective. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_axis`: Defines the label or identifier for the X-axis, contributing to the plot's contextual understanding. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_values`: Represents the data points or conditions along the X-axis, directly influencing the plot's horizontal distribution. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_axis`: Defines the label or identifier for the Y-axis, contributing to the plot's contextual understanding. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `y_values`: Represents the data points or conditions along the Y-axis, directly influencing the plot's vertical distribution. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: An optional pipeline parameter that can be used to pass additional information or settings for the plot generation process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The modified or new pipeline configuration, including any changes or additions made through the plot settings. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
