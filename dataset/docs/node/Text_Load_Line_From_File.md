- `Text Load Line From File`: This node is designed to load a specific line or the next line from a text file based on the provided mode. It supports automatic sequential reading, reading by index, and handling multiline text inputs. The node integrates with a database for tracking read positions and file paths, facilitating efficient text batch processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `file_path`: Specifies the path to the text file from which a line will be loaded. It's essential for locating and accessing the file's content. The path influences which file is accessed for reading, directly affecting the text that is loaded and processed. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `dictionary_name`: Defines the name of the dictionary key under which the loaded lines will be stored. This can be customized or set to the default, which is the filename. The choice of dictionary name impacts how the loaded text is referenced and utilized in subsequent operations, allowing for organized storage and retrieval. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `label`: A label used for tracking the reading position in the file across multiple invocations, enabling sequential reading in 'automatic' mode. This label is crucial for maintaining continuity in text processing, ensuring that each invocation reads from the correct position in the file. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mode`: Determines the method of line selection: 'automatic' for sequential reading, 'index' for specific line access, or handling 'multiline_text' directly. The mode selection dictates how the text is accessed and loaded, influencing the node's behavior and the outcome of the text loading process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `index`: When mode is set to 'index', this specifies the exact line number to be read from the file. This parameter is key in pinpointing a specific line for retrieval, directly determining which line of text is loaded when the 'index' mode is chosen. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiline_text`: Allows direct input of text content, bypassing file reading, and supports line selection based on the mode and index. This input provides an alternative way to supply text, offering flexibility in handling text data without relying on file access. It affects the node's execution by enabling direct manipulation of text content. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `line_text`: The specific line of text loaded from the file or the multiline text input, based on the selection mode. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `dictionary`: A dictionary containing the loaded lines under a specified key, useful for further processing or analysis. Type should be `DICT`.
