- `CLIPTextEncode (NSP)`: This node specializes in encoding text inputs using CLIP models, enhanced with Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP) or wildcard text transformations. It aims to provide a versatile text encoding capability that can adapt to different prompt styles and requirements, making it suitable for a wide range of text-to-image or text-based conditioning applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Determines whether Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcards are used for text transformation. This choice affects how the text is parsed and encoded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `noodle_key`: A key used in Noodle Soup Prompts for dynamic text replacement. It's essential for customizing the prompt transformation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: A seed for random number generation, used in text transformation to ensure reproducibility or variability. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text`: The text input to be encoded. This can include Noodle Soup Prompts or wildcards, which are then transformed based on the mode selected. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model to be used for encoding the text. It plays a crucial role in determining the quality and relevance of the encoded output. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The encoded text output, suitable for use in text-to-image generation or other conditioning contexts. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `parsed_text`: The text after being processed by NSP or wildcard transformation, providing insight into how the input text was interpreted. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `raw_text`: The original text input before any NSP or wildcard transformation, allowing for comparison with the parsed text. Type should be `STRING`.
