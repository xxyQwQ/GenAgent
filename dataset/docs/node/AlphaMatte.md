- `AlphaMatte`: The AlphaMatte node is designed for advanced image processing, specifically focusing on extracting and refining the alpha matte of images. It utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately separate foreground from background, even in complex scenes, by analyzing images alongside their alpha trimaps. This node is capable of handling pre-blurring, adjusting black and white points, and performing iterative refinements to achieve high-quality matte extraction.
    - Parameters:
        - `preblur`: Specifies the amount of pre-blurring applied to the trimap to smooth out hard edges and improve the matte extraction. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blackpoint`: The black point value used to adjust the contrast of the trimap, aiding in clearer separation of the foreground from the background. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `whitepoint`: The white point value for adjusting the trimap's brightness, enhancing the distinction between foreground and background areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_iterations`: The maximum number of iterations allowed for refining the alpha matte, ensuring a balance between quality and computational efficiency. Type should be `INT`.
        - `estimate_fg`: A flag indicating whether to estimate the foreground in addition to the alpha matte, providing a more complete separation of image elements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images for which the alpha matte needs to be extracted. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the matte extraction process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `alpha_trimap`: A trimap providing an initial guess of the foreground, background, and unknown areas, which guides the matte extraction process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `alpha`: The extracted alpha matte, representing the transparency levels of the foreground elements in the image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `fg`: The estimated foreground of the image, obtained when the estimate_fg flag is true. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `bg`: The estimated background of the image, useful for compositing or further processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
