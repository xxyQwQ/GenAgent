- `StringToNumber`: The `StringToNumber` node converts a string representation of a number into its numerical form, offering options for rounding the result to the nearest integer, flooring it, or ceiling it. This functionality is essential for scenarios where numerical values are received as text and precise mathematical operations or comparisons are required.
    - Parameters:
        - `string`: The `string` parameter takes a string input that represents a number, which is then converted into a numerical form. This conversion is crucial for further numerical operations or analyses. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `rounding`: The `rounding` parameter specifies the method of rounding (nearest, floor, or ceil) to be applied to the converted number, affecting the final numerical output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: The integer part of the converted number, after applying the specified rounding method. Type should be `INT`.
        - `float`: The floating-point representation of the converted number, providing a precise numerical value. Type should be `FLOAT`.
