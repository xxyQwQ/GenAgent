- `JWImageResizeByShorterSide`: This node resizes an image by adjusting its shorter side to a specified size while maintaining the aspect ratio, using various interpolation methods for the resizing process.
    - Parameters:
        - `size`: The target size for the shorter side of the image, ensuring the aspect ratio is preserved during resizing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation_mode`: Specifies the method used for interpolating the pixels in the resized image, affecting the visual quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image tensor to be resized. It's crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo resizing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resized image tensor, with its shorter side adjusted to the specified size while maintaining the original aspect ratio. Type should be `IMAGE`.
