- `unCLIP Checkpoint Loader`: The unCLIP Checkpoint Loader node is designed for loading checkpoints specifically tailored for the unCLIP model. It facilitates the retrieval and initialization of model components such as the CLIP model, VAE, and CLIP vision, ensuring they are correctly configured and ready for use in various applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The 'ckpt_name' parameter specifies the name of the checkpoint to be loaded. It is crucial for identifying the correct file within the 'checkpoints' directory, enabling the node to fetch and load the model's state. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: Represents the loaded model, ready for further processing or inference. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The CLIP component of the loaded checkpoint, prepared for text and image understanding tasks. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `VAE`: The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) component, useful for generative tasks. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `CLIP_VISION`: The CLIP vision component, optimized for visual understanding tasks. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `NAME_STRING`: The name of the checkpoint, extracted from the 'ckpt_name' parameter, providing a string identifier for the loaded checkpoint. Type should be `STRING`.
