- `LatentStats`: The LatentStats node is designed to analyze and report statistics of latent representations in a neural network model. It calculates and prints various statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for different components of the latent space, providing insights into the characteristics of the data being processed.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `latent`: The 'latent' parameter represents the latent representations to be analyzed. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly influences the statistical calculations and the resulting output. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `stats`: A string summarizing the statistical analysis of the latent representations, including batch size, dimensions, and statistics for each component. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `c0_mean`: The mean value of the first component in the latent representations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `c1_mean`: The mean value of the second component in the latent representations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `c2_mean`: The mean value of the third component in the latent representations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `c3_mean`: The mean value of the fourth component in the latent representations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
