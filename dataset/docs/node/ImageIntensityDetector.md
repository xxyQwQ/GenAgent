- `ImageIntensityDetector`: The ImageIntensityDetector node is designed for preprocessing images by adjusting their intensity levels. This adjustment is achieved through gamma correction, enhancing the image's overall visibility and contrast before further processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `gamma_correction`: Specifies the gamma correction factor to adjust the image's intensity. A higher value brightens the image, while a lower value darkens it, significantly impacting the visual quality of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `resolution`: The resolution to which the image is resized before applying the intensity adjustment, affecting the detail level of the output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for intensity adjustment through gamma correction. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with adjusted intensity levels, suitable for visual analysis or further image processing tasks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
