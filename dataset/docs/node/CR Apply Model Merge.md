- `CR Apply Model Merge`: This node is designed to merge multiple models and CLIPs based on specified ratios, normalization settings, and merge methods. It supports weighted merging and normalization of ratios to ensure the combined model accurately reflects the desired blend of input models.
    - Parameters:
        - `merge_method`: Specifies the method used for merging models, such as weighted merging, affecting how input models are combined. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `normalise_ratios`: Indicates whether the ratios of models and CLIPs should be normalized, ensuring their sum equals 1 for a balanced merge. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_factor`: A factor used in weighted merging to adjust the influence of each model in the final merge. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model_stack`: A stack of models to be merged, each accompanied by model and CLIP ratios. It's crucial for determining the composition of the final merged model. Type should be `MODEL_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The final merged model resulting from the combination of input models according to specified methods and ratios. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The final merged CLIP model resulting from the combination of input CLIP models according to specified methods and ratios. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `model_mix_info`: Information about the merged models, including names, ratios, and any normalization or weighting adjustments applied. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing additional help and documentation on how to use the node effectively. Type should be `STRING`.
