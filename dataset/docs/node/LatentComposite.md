- `LatentComposite`: The LatentComposite node is designed to blend or merge two latent representations into a single output. This process is essential for creating composite images or features by combining the characteristics of the input latents in a controlled manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `x`: The x-coordinate (horizontal position) where the 'samples_from' latent will be placed on the 'samples_to'. It determines the horizontal alignment of the composite. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate (vertical position) where the 'samples_from' latent will be placed on the 'samples_to'. It determines the vertical alignment of the composite. Type should be `INT`.
        - `feather`: A boolean indicating whether the 'samples_from' latent should be resized to match the 'samples_to' before compositing. This can affect the scale and proportion of the composite result. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples_to`: The 'samples_to' latent representation where the 'samples_from' will be composited onto. It serves as the base for the composite operation. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `samples_from`: The 'samples_from' latent representation to be composited onto the 'samples_to'. It contributes its features or characteristics to the final composite output. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a composite latent representation, blending the features of both 'samples_to' and 'samples_from' latents based on the specified coordinates and resizing option. Type should be `LATENT`.
