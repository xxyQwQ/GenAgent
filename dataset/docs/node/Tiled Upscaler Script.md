- `Tiled Upscaler Script`: The Tiled Upscaler Script node is designed to enhance image resolution through a process of tiled sampling and upscaling. It leverages various upscaling strategies, including latent and pixel-based methods, to improve image quality while maintaining efficiency. This node is capable of handling different tiling strategies, applying denoise filters, and optionally utilizing control nets for more precise upscaling results.
    - Parameters:
        - `upscale_by`: Specifies the factor by which the image should be upscaled. It affects the overall resolution enhancement of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tile_size`: Determines the size of the tiles used in the upscaling process, impacting the granularity of the upscaling and potentially the performance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tiling_strategy`: Defines the approach for tiling during the upscaling process, influencing how the image is segmented and processed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `tiling_steps`: Indicates the number of steps or iterations to perform during the tiling process, affecting the depth of the upscaling operation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: Provides a seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the upscaling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `denoise`: Enables or disables the application of a denoise filter during the upscaling process, affecting image clarity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_controlnet`: Determines whether a control net is used in the upscaling process, allowing for more precise adjustments. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `tile_controlnet`: Specifies the control net to be applied if use_controlnet is true, guiding the upscaling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: Adjusts the intensity of the upscaling effect, allowing for finer control over the final image appearance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `script`: Optional script parameters that can be used to customize the upscaling process further. Type should be `SCRIPT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `script`: Returns the modified script with upscaling parameters included, ready for further processing. Type should be `SCRIPT`.
