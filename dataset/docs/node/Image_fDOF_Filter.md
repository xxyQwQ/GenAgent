- `Image fDOF Filter`: The node focuses on applying a field of depth effect to images, simulating the depth-of-field effect often seen in photography. This effect can make a subject stand out by blurring the background or foreground in relation to the subject's focus distance.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Determines the type of blur to be applied, offering options such as 'mock', 'gaussian', and 'box' to simulate different depth-of-field effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `radius`: Controls the radius of the blur effect, affecting the extent of the area that appears out of focus. Type should be `INT`.
        - `samples`: Defines the number of samples to be used in the blur effect, influencing the quality and intensity of the depth-of-field simulation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to which the field of depth effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial for determining the areas of focus and blur within the image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `depth`: Specifies the depth information for each part of the image, used to calculate the blur intensity in relation to the subject's focus distance. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image with the field of depth effect applied, showcasing areas of focus and blur based on the specified parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
