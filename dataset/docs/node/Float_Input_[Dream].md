- `Float Input [Dream]`: The Float Input node is designed to accept a floating-point number as input, providing a simple interface for users to input decimal values. It serves as a foundational element in user interfaces where numerical input is required, particularly for configurations that involve precise measurements or adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `value`: Represents the floating-point number that the user inputs. It is the primary value the node operates on, serving as the basis for further processing or computation within the node's workflow. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `FLOAT`: Outputs the same floating-point number that was input, effectively acting as a pass-through for the value. Type should be `FLOAT`.
