- `SeargeUpscaleModels`: This node is designed to configure and manage upscale models within a UI context, specifically for enhancing image resolution through various upscaling techniques. It allows for the selection and application of different upscaling models, including detail processing and high-resolution upscaling, to improve image quality.
    - Parameters:
        - `detail_processor`: Specifies the model used for detail enhancement in images, playing a crucial role in refining image textures and details without altering the overall resolution. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `high_res_upscaler`: Defines the model responsible for increasing the image resolution by a factor of 4x, essential for achieving high-resolution outputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `primary_upscaler`: Identifies the primary model used for the initial phase of image upscaling, crucial for the first step in enhancing image resolution. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `secondary_upscaler`: Specifies the secondary model applied after the primary upscaling, offering an additional layer of refinement and quality improvement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `data`: Optional data stream for passing additional information or parameters relevant to the upscaling process. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: Returns a data stream containing the configured upscale models and any additional parameters, ready for further processing or application. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
