- `SeargeConditioningMuxer2`: The SeargeConditioningMuxer2 node is designed for selecting one of two conditioning inputs based on a selector input. It facilitates dynamic control over which conditioning data is passed forward in a processing pipeline, allowing for flexible manipulation of conditioning contexts.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_selector`: An integer selector that determines which of the two conditioning inputs (input0 or input1) is passed forward. A value of 0 selects input0, while a value of 1 selects input1. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `input0`: The first conditioning input option. This input represents one of the potential conditioning contexts to be selected. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `input1`: The second conditioning input option. Similar to input0, this represents an alternative conditioning context that can be selected. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `output`: The selected conditioning input, determined by the value of the input_selector. This output carries forward the chosen conditioning context for further processing. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
