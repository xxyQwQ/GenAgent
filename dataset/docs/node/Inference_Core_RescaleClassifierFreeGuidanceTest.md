- `Inference_Core_RescaleClassifierFreeGuidanceTest`: This node applies a custom patch to a given model, enhancing its inference capabilities by rescaling the classifier-free guidance process. It adjusts the balance between conditioned and unconditioned generation through a specified multiplier, aiming to improve the model's output quality.
    - Parameters:
        - `multiplier`: A scalar value that adjusts the balance between conditioned and unconditioned generation, influencing the final output quality of the model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to be patched, which will have its classifier-free guidance process rescaled for improved inference performance. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The patched model with an adjusted classifier-free guidance process for enhanced inference performance. Type should be `MODEL`.
