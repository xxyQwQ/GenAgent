- `Create Rect Mask`: The Create Rect Mask node is designed to generate rectangular masks based on specified dimensions and origin points. It supports creating masks in either percentage or pixel modes, allowing for flexible mask creation relative to the image size. This node can also adapt the mask size automatically if a reference image is provided, ensuring the mask aligns perfectly with the image dimensions.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the mode of dimension calculation for the mask, either as a percentage of the image size or in absolute pixels, affecting how the mask's dimensions are interpreted. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `origin`: Determines the starting point of the mask within the image, which can be any of the four corners, influencing the mask's position. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x`: The x-coordinate of the mask's origin, which sets the horizontal starting point of the mask. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate of the mask's origin, which sets the vertical starting point of the mask. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `width`: The width of the mask, which can be defined in pixels or as a percentage of the image width, depending on the mode. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `height`: The height of the mask, which can be defined in pixels or as a percentage of the image height, depending on the mode. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `image_width`: The width of the image to which the mask will be applied. This parameter is ignored if copy_image_size is provided. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_height`: The height of the image to which the mask will be applied. This parameter is ignored if copy_image_size is provided. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `copy_image_size`: An optional image parameter. If provided, the mask dimensions will be automatically adjusted to match the size of this reference image, overriding the image_width and image_height parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Outputs a rectangular mask as a tensor, with dimensions and position based on the input parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
