- `CR Draw Pie`: The CR_DrawPie node is designed for creating pie-shaped graphics with customizable start and stop angles, colors, and positioning. It allows users to generate pie or partial pie shapes with specific dimensions, colors, and orientations, facilitating the creation of unique graphical representations.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the canvas on which the pie shape will be drawn. It determines the horizontal dimension of the output image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the canvas on which the pie shape will be drawn. It determines the vertical dimension of the output image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pie_start`: Defines the starting angle of the pie shape. This angle sets the beginning point of the pie or partial pie segment. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pie_stop`: Defines the stopping angle of the pie shape. This angle sets the end point of the pie or partial pie segment, completing its arc. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `shape_color`: Determines the color of the pie shape. This color fills the interior of the pie or partial pie segment. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `back_color`: Sets the background color of the canvas. It affects the overall appearance of the output image by providing a backdrop for the pie shape. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_offset`: Adjusts the horizontal position of the pie shape on the canvas. It allows for precise placement of the pie segment within the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y_offset`: Adjusts the vertical position of the pie shape on the canvas. It allows for precise placement of the pie segment within the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `zoom`: Controls the zoom level of the pie shape. This parameter can enlarge or reduce the size of the pie segment, affecting its visual impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `rotation`: Rotates the pie shape around its center. This parameter can orient the pie segment at various angles, offering additional customization. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `shape_color_hex`: Specifies the hex code for the pie shape's color, offering an alternative to the predefined color options. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `bg_color_hex`: Specifies the hex code for the background color, offering an alternative to the predefined color options. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: Generates an image file containing the pie or partial pie shape as specified by the input parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a string output that can offer guidance or additional information about the generated pie shape. Type should be `STRING`.
