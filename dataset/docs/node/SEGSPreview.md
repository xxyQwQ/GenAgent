- `SEGSPreview`: The SEGSPreview node is designed to generate previews of segmentation images, specifically focusing on the control network aspect of these images. It processes a batch of segmentation data, extracting and saving control network images for each segment, and returns a list of these images along with their metadata.
    - Parameters:
        - `alpha_mode`: This parameter determines the mode of alpha blending used in the preview generation, affecting the transparency and overlay of images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `min_alpha`: Specifies the minimum alpha value for transparency in the preview images, controlling the visibility of underlying layers. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The 'segs' parameter represents the segmentation data to be processed. It is crucial for generating the control network images and their previews, as it contains the necessary information for each segment. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `fallback_image_opt`: An optional fallback image to use when segmentation data is incomplete or missing, ensuring a default visual is available. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The 'image' output type represents the final image or images generated by the node, encapsulating the visual result of the processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
