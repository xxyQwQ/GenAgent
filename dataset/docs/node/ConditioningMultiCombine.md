- `ConditioningMultiCombine`: This node is designed to aggregate multiple conditioning inputs into a single, unified conditioning output. It leverages the capabilities of other conditioning nodes to sequentially combine conditioning data, facilitating complex conditioning scenarios in a streamlined manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `inputcount`: Specifies the number of conditioning inputs to be combined. It determines the execution flow by dictating how many conditioning inputs will be processed and merged. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning_i`: Represents a series of conditioning inputs to be combined, starting from 'conditioning_1' to 'conditioning_{inputcount}'. Each serves as an incremental addition to the combined conditioning output, facilitating a sequential combination process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `combined`: The result of combining the specified conditioning inputs into a single conditioning output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `inputcount`: Returns the number of conditioning inputs that were combined. Type should be `INT`.
