- `MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider __Inspire`: The MediaPipeFaceMeshDetectorProvider node is designed to facilitate the detection of facial landmarks using MediaPipe's FaceMesh technology within the ComfyUI framework. It serves as a provider for integrating FaceMesh detection capabilities into segmentation or other image processing pipelines, enabling advanced facial analysis and manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_faces`: Specifies the maximum number of faces to detect in the given image, controlling the scope of the detection process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `face`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the face feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `mouth`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the mouth feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `left_eyebrow`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the left eyebrow feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `left_eye`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the left eye feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `left_pupil`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the left pupil feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `right_eyebrow`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the right eyebrow feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `right_eye`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the right eye feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `right_pupil`: Indicates the presence and configuration of the right pupil feature for detection. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `bbox_detector`: Provides a detector configured for bounding box detection of facial features. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `segm_detector`: Provides a detector configured for segmentation detection of facial features. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
