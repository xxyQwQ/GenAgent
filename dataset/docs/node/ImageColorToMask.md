- `ImageColorToMask`: The ImageColorToMask node is designed to convert a specified color in an image to a mask. It processes an image and a target color, generating a mask where the specified color is highlighted, facilitating operations like color-based segmentation or object isolation.
    - Parameters:
        - `color`: The 'color' parameter specifies the target color in the image to be converted into a mask. It plays a key role in identifying the specific color areas to be highlighted in the resulting mask. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The 'image' parameter represents the input image to be processed. It is crucial for determining the areas of the image that match the specified color to be converted into a mask. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output is a mask highlighting the areas of the input image that match the specified color. This mask can be used for further image processing tasks, such as segmentation or object isolation. Type should be `MASK`.
