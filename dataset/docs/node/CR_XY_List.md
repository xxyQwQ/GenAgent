- `CR XY List`: The CR XY List node is designed to generate a pair of outputs based on the Cartesian product of two input lists, with additional functionality to prepend and append custom text to each element. It also provides annotations for the last iteration of the Cartesian product, facilitating complex list manipulations and grid-based operations.
    - Parameters:
        - `index`: The index to select a specific pair from the Cartesian product. Indexing starts from 1. Type should be `INT`.
        - `list1`: The first list to participate in the Cartesian product. Elements from this list are combined with elements from the second list to generate the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `x_prepend`: Text to prepend to each element of the first list in the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `x_append`: Text to append to each element of the first list in the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `x_annotation_prepend`: Text to prepend to the annotation of each element of the first list. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `list2`: The second list to participate in the Cartesian product. It is combined with elements from the first list to generate the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_prepend`: Text to prepend to each element of the second list in the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_append`: Text to append to each element of the second list in the output pairs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_annotation_prepend`: Text to prepend to the annotation of each element of the second list. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `X`: The processed output from the first list after applying prepend and append operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Y`: The processed output from the second list after applying prepend and append operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `x_annotation`: The annotation for all elements of the first list after the last iteration of the Cartesian product. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_annotation`: The annotation for all elements of the second list after the last iteration of the Cartesian product. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `trigger`: A boolean flag indicating if the current iteration is the last one in the Cartesian product. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `show_help`: A URL to the help documentation for the CR XY List node. Type should be `STRING`.
