- `Create Morph Image`: This node is designed to generate a morphing animation between two or more images, creating a smooth transition effect. It allows for customization of the transition duration, frame rate, and output settings, making it versatile for creating dynamic visual content.
    - Parameters:
        - `transition_frames`: Defines the number of frames to be generated between the starting and ending images, controlling the smoothness of the transition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `still_image_delay_ms`: The duration in milliseconds for which each image remains still before transitioning to the next, enhancing the visual effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `duration_ms`: The duration in milliseconds of each transition step, affecting the speed of the morphing animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `loops`: Determines the number of times the animation loops, allowing for repeated playback. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_size`: Specifies the maximum size of the images, ensuring they are resized appropriately for consistent morphing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_path`: The file path where the generated morphing animation will be saved. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `filename`: The name of the output file, allowing for easy identification and organization. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `filetype`: The format of the output file, typically GIF for animations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image_a`: The first image in the morphing sequence. It serves as the starting point for the morphing animation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_b`: The second image in the morphing sequence. It serves as the ending point for the morphing animation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image_a_pass`: The first image after processing, confirming its successful inclusion in the morphing animation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_b_pass`: The second image after processing, confirming its successful inclusion in the morphing animation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `filepath_text`: The path to the generated morphing animation file, providing access to the final visual content. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `filename_text`: The name of the generated morphing animation file, facilitating easy identification and retrieval. Type should be `STRING`.
