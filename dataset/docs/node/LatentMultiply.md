- `LatentMultiply`: The LatentMultiply node is designed to scale the latent representation of samples by a specified multiplier. This operation allows for the adjustment of the intensity or magnitude of features within the latent space, enabling fine-tuning of generated content or the exploration of variations within a given latent direction.
    - Parameters:
        - `multiplier`: The 'multiplier' parameter specifies the scaling factor to be applied to the latent samples. It plays a key role in adjusting the magnitude of the latent features, allowing for nuanced control over the generated output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples`: The 'samples' parameter represents the latent representations to be scaled. It is crucial for defining the input data on which the multiplication operation will be performed. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a modified version of the input latent samples, scaled by the specified multiplier. This allows for the exploration of variations within the latent space by adjusting the intensity of its features. Type should be `LATENT`.
