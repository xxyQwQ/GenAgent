- `CLIPTextEncode (BlenderNeko Advanced + NSP)`: This node specializes in encoding text inputs using an advanced CLIP model, enhanced by BlenderNeko's modifications and optionally incorporating Noodle Soup Prompts (NSP) for dynamic text manipulation. It aims to provide a more nuanced and contextually aware text representation for downstream tasks, such as image generation or text-based conditioning.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Determines the mode of text manipulation, such as using Noodle Soup Prompts for dynamic text changes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `noodle_key`: A key used in Noodle Soup Prompts for identifying placeholders in the text to be dynamically replaced. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: A seed for random elements in text manipulation, ensuring reproducibility of the text encoding. Type should be `INT`.
        - `token_normalization`: Determines how tokens are normalized during encoding, affecting the representation's sensitivity to token frequency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_interpretation`: Controls how the weights are interpreted in the encoding process, influencing the emphasis on certain aspects of the text. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text`: The input text to be encoded. This text can be dynamically modified based on the mode selected, allowing for creative and context-sensitive text representations. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for encoding the text. It's crucial for understanding the context and semantics of the input text. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The encoded text representation, suitable for use in downstream tasks like image generation. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `parsed_text`: The text after being processed and potentially modified by the node, reflecting dynamic changes or manipulations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `raw_text`: The original input text before any processing or manipulation. Type should be `STRING`.
