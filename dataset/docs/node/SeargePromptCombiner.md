        - `separator`: A string used to separate the two prompts when combined. This allows for customizable spacing or punctuation between prompt elements. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `prompt2`: The second prompt to be combined. It follows the separator and completes the merged prompt. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `combined prompt`: The result of merging prompt1 and prompt2, optionally separated by the separator. This is the final, combined prompt ready for use. Type should be `STRING`.
