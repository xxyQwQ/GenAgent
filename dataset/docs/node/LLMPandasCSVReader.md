- `LLMPandasCSVReader`: The LLMPandasCSVReader node specializes in reading CSV files and transforming them into llama_index Documents, incorporating additional configuration options for joining rows and columns. This node enhances the flexibility in processing CSV data by allowing custom concatenation strategies, making it suitable for a wide range of data preparation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `path`: Specifies the file path to the CSV file to be read, serving as the primary data source for the node. The path's validity directly impacts the node's ability to access and process the specified CSV file. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `concat_rows`: Determines whether rows should be concatenated during the reading process, affecting how data is aggregated and presented in the output Documents. This option allows for tailored data structuring to meet specific analysis needs. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
        - `col_joiner`: Specifies the string to be used for joining column values when concatenating rows, influencing the format and readability of the concatenated data. This parameter enables precise control over the data's presentation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `row_joiner`: Specifies the string to be used for joining row values, impacting the structure and organization of the output Documents. This allows for customized data formatting, enhancing the node's adaptability to various data analysis scenarios. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `extra_info`: Allows for the inclusion of additional, user-defined information to be processed along with the CSV data. This parameter can enrich the output Documents with context or metadata, thereby increasing the node's utility in complex data processing tasks. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `documents`: Outputs the processed data as llama_index Documents, ready for further processing or analysis. The structure and content of these Documents are shaped by the input parameters, enabling tailored data preparation. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
