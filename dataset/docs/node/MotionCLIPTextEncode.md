- `MotionCLIPTextEncode`: The MotionCLIPTextEncode node is designed to encode textual descriptions into a format suitable for motion generation tasks, leveraging a CLIP model and motion data to produce motion conditioning. This process facilitates the creation of motion sequences that are aligned with the given textual descriptions.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The text parameter is the textual description to be encoded, serving as the input for generating motion-aligned sequences. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `md_clip`: The md_clip parameter represents a CLIP model tailored for motion data, crucial for interpreting and encoding the textual description in the context of motion. Type should be `MD_CLIP`.
        - `motion_data`: The motion_data parameter contains the motion information necessary for the encoding process, providing the context in which the text is to be interpreted. Type should be `MOTION_DATA`.
    - Outputs:
        - `md_conditioning`: The output is motion conditioning data, which is used to guide the generation of motion sequences that correspond to the input text. Type should be `MD_CONDITIONING`.
