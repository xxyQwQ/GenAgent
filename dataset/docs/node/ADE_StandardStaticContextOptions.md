- `ADE_StandardStaticContextOptions`: This node is designed to generate a set of static context options for the Animate Diff process, providing a standardized configuration for animation generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `context_length`: Specifies the length of the context to be used in the animation, determining how many frames or steps are considered for each segment of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_overlap`: Defines the overlap between consecutive contexts in the animation, affecting the smoothness and continuity between frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fuse_method`: Determines the method used to fuse multiple contexts together, influencing the final animation's fluidity and coherence. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_on_equal_length`: A boolean flag that specifies whether to use the fuse method when contexts are of equal length, affecting the animation's uniformity. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `start_percent`: Defines the starting point of the animation as a percentage, allowing for customization of where the animation begins within the provided context. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guarantee_steps`: Ensures a minimum number of steps or frames in the animation, providing a baseline for animation smoothness and continuity. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_context`: Allows for the integration of previously defined context options, enabling the chaining or layering of context configurations for complex animations. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
        - `view_opts`: Specifies view options for the animation, offering additional customization for how the animation is rendered and displayed. Type should be `VIEW_OPTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONTEXT_OPTS`: Outputs a configured set of context options tailored for static animation scenarios, ready for use in the Animate Diff process. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
