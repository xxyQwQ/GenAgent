- `Inference_Core_ModelSamplerTonemapNoiseTest`: This node applies a tonemapping technique to modify the noise prediction vector magnitude in a model's sampler, aiming to enhance image generation quality by adjusting the contrast and brightness based on the Reinhard tonemapping algorithm. It allows for dynamic adjustment of the effect through a multiplier, facilitating experimentation with different levels of tonemapping intensity.
    - Parameters:
        - `multiplier`: A scalar value used to adjust the intensity of the tonemapping effect applied to the noise prediction vector magnitude, allowing for fine-tuning of the image's contrast and brightness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to which the tonemapping technique will be applied. This is crucial for modifying the model's internal sampler configuration to achieve the desired image generation enhancements. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model with an updated sampler configuration that incorporates the tonemapping technique, aimed at improving image generation quality. Type should be `MODEL`.
