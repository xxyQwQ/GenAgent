- `LatentInterpolate`: The LatentInterpolate node is designed to perform interpolation between two sets of latent samples based on a specified ratio, blending the characteristics of both sets to produce a new, intermediate set of latent samples.
    - Parameters:
        - `ratio`: A floating-point value that determines the weight of each set of samples in the interpolated output. A ratio of 0 produces a copy of the first set, while a ratio of 1 produces a copy of the second set. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples1`: The first set of latent samples to be interpolated. It serves as the starting point for the interpolation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `samples2`: The second set of latent samples to be interpolated. It serves as the endpoint for the interpolation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a new set of latent samples that represent an interpolated state between the two input sets, based on the specified ratio. Type should be `LATENT`.
