- `Image Paste Crop by Location`: This node specializes in pasting a cropped image onto a specified location within another image, allowing for blending and sharpening adjustments. It provides the capability to seamlessly integrate a cropped image into a larger canvas, with options to fine-tune the integration through blending gradients and sharpening effects, enhancing the overall composition.
    - Parameters:
        - `top`: The top coordinate where the cropped image will be placed on the base image. It determines the vertical positioning of the crop. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left`: The left coordinate where the cropped image will be placed on the base image. It determines the horizontal positioning of the crop. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right`: The right boundary for the cropping operation, affecting how the image blends on the right side. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom`: The bottom boundary for the cropping operation, affecting how the image blends on the bottom side. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_blending`: The degree to which the cropped image blends with the base image at the edges, creating a gradient transition. This parameter allows for a smoother integration of the crop into the base image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `crop_sharpening`: The intensity of the sharpening effect applied to the cropped image. This parameter can enhance the details of the crop, making it stand out more or blend better with the base image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The base image onto which the cropped image will be pasted. It serves as the canvas for the operation, determining the final image's dimensions and serving as the background for the pasted crop. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_image`: The cropped image to be pasted onto the base image. This image is the focal point of the operation, and its placement and appearance adjustments (blending and sharpening) significantly influence the outcome. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after the cropped image has been pasted, blended, and optionally sharpened onto the base image. It represents the final composition, showcasing the integrated appearance of the crop within the larger canvas. Type should be `IMAGE`.
