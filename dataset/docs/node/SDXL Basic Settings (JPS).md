- `SDXL Basic Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to configure the basic settings for SDXL image generation, including resolution, sampler, scheduler, and various parameters related to image refinement and generation steps. It abstracts the complexity of setting up these parameters, providing a streamlined interface for users to easily adjust the core settings that influence the quality and characteristics of the generated images.
    - Parameters:
        - `resolution`: Specifies the desired resolution for the image generation, chosen from a predefined list of resolutions. This setting directly impacts the dimensions of the output image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sampler_name`: Determines the sampler to be used for image generation, affecting the sampling process and the quality of the generated image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Specifies the scheduler for managing the sampling process, influencing how the generation steps are executed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `steps_total`: The total number of steps to be used in the image generation process, impacting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `base_percentage`: Defines the base percentage of the image to be generated in the initial steps, influencing the progression of image detail. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration parameter for controlling the generation process, affecting the coherence and quality of the generated image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cfg_rescale`: Parameter for rescaling the configuration value, allowing for fine-tuning of the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cfg_refiner`: Adjusts the configuration for refining the generation process, enhancing the quality of the final image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ascore_refiner`: Refines the ascore to adjust the quality of the generated image, impacting the final image aesthetics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `res_factor`: Factor for adjusting the resolution of the generated image, influencing the overall image quality. Type should be `INT`.
        - `clip_skip`: Determines the number of clipping steps to skip in the generation process, affecting the final image output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `filename`: The filename for the generated image, used for saving and identifying the output file. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `sdxl_basic_settings`: Encapsulates the configured basic settings for SDXL image generation, including resolution, sampler, scheduler, and various parameters for image refinement and generation steps. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
