- `BasicGuider`: Provides a mechanism to create a guider object with basic conditioning for custom sampling processes. It encapsulates the functionality to apply simple conditions to guide the sampling process.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for guiding the sampling process, serving as the foundation for the guider's operations. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `conditioning`: Defines the conditions under which the sampling should occur, directly influencing the behavior and output of the guider. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `guider`: The output is a guider object configured with the specified model and conditioning, ready to guide the sampling process. Type should be `GUIDER`.
