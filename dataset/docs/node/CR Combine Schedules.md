- `CR Combine Schedules`: The CR Combine Schedules node is designed to merge multiple animation schedules into a single comprehensive schedule. It facilitates the integration of various animation sequences by combining their schedules, enhancing the flexibility and complexity of animation planning.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `schedule_1`: Represents the first animation schedule to be combined. Its inclusion allows for the sequential integration of multiple schedules, contributing to the creation of a unified animation timeline. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
        - `schedule_2`: Represents the second animation schedule to be combined, further enriching the unified animation timeline by adding its sequence. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
        - `schedule_3`: Represents the third animation schedule to be combined, adding another layer of complexity to the unified animation timeline. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
        - `schedule_4`: Represents the fourth animation schedule to be combined, completing the integration of multiple animation sequences into a single comprehensive schedule. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `SCHEDULE`: The combined list of schedules from all provided animation sequences. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
        - `show_text`: A concatenated string representation of all schedules, intended for display or debugging purposes. Type should be `STRING`.
