- `SaltMaskFillRegion`: This node is designed to fill regions within masks, transforming the input masks by identifying and filling specified regions to produce modified masks.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `masks`: The input masks to be processed for region filling. This parameter is crucial for determining the areas within each mask that will undergo the filling operation. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MASKS`: The output consists of masks with specified regions filled, resulting from the processing of the input masks. Type should be `MASK`.
