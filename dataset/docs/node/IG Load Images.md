- `IG Load Images`: The IG Load Images From Folder node is designed for efficiently loading multiple images from a specified folder, offering options to limit the number of images loaded, skip a certain number of initial images, and select images at a specified interval. This functionality is crucial for managing and preprocessing large datasets of images for further analysis or processing within a pipeline.

        - `image_load_cap`: Limits the number of images to be loaded from the folder. If set to 0, there is no limit. Type should be `INT`.
        - `skip_first_images`: Skips a specified number of images from the beginning of the folder. Useful for starting the loading process from a certain point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `select_every_nth`: Loads every nth image from the folder, allowing for selective loading of images at regular intervals. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The loaded images from the specified folder. Type should be `IMAGE`.
