- `CR Aspect Ratio Banners`: This node is designed to adjust the aspect ratio of banners, allowing for customization of width, height, and aspect ratio parameters. It supports operations such as swapping dimensions, upscaling, and prescaling, catering to various banner size requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the desired width of the banner. It plays a crucial role in determining the final dimensions of the banner after aspect ratio adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Defines the desired height of the banner. This parameter is essential for calculating the banner's dimensions in accordance with the specified aspect ratio. Type should be `INT`.
        - `aspect_ratio`: Determines the target aspect ratio for the banner. This parameter is key to achieving the desired proportion between width and height. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `swap_dimensions`: Allows for the swapping of width and height dimensions. This feature is useful for adapting the banner to different orientation requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `upscale_factor`: Specifies the factor by which the banner's dimensions should be upscaled. This parameter enables the enlargement of banners while maintaining their aspect ratio. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `prescale_factor`: Indicates the factor by which the banner's dimensions should be prescaled before any other adjustments. This is useful for initial size modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `batch_size`: Defines the number of banners to process in a single batch. This parameter helps in optimizing the processing of multiple banners simultaneously. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `width`: The adjusted width of the banner after applying the specified aspect ratio and other adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The adjusted height of the banner after applying the specified aspect ratio and other adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_factor`: The factor by which the banner's dimensions have been upscaled. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `prescale_factor`: The factor by which the banner's dimensions have been prescaled before any other adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `batch_size`: The number of banners processed in the batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent`: A tensor representing the latent space of the processed banners. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `show_help`: A URL to the help documentation for using the aspect ratio node. Type should be `STRING`.
