- `ADE_RegisterModelAsLoraHookModelOnly`: This node specializes in registering a model as a LoRA hook with a focus on model-only modifications. It enables the integration of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques into a specific model, enhancing its adaptability and performance for specific tasks without affecting other components.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The name of the checkpoint to apply LoRA configurations from. This parameter specifies which set of LoRA adaptations to use, guiding the customization of the model's behavior. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_model`: A floating-point value that determines the intensity of the LoRA adaptation on the model. It modulates how significantly the LoRA parameters influence the model's behavior. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to be adapted using LoRA techniques. It serves as the primary target for the application of low-rank adaptations, aiming to enhance its performance or adaptability for specific tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model after applying the specified LoRA adaptations. This output reflects the enhanced or customized version of the model, tailored through the LoRA technique. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `lora_hook`: A reference to the LoRA hook that has been integrated into the model. This output provides access to the LoRA adaptations applied, facilitating further manipulations or analyses. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
