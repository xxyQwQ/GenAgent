- `SamplerDPMPP_2M_SDE`: This node is designed to generate a sampler for the DPMPP_2M_SDE model, allowing for the creation of samples based on specified solver types, noise levels, and computational device preferences. It abstracts the complexities of sampler configuration, providing a streamlined interface for generating samples with customized settings.
    - Parameters:
        - `solver_type`: Specifies the solver type to be used in the sampling process, offering options between 'midpoint' and 'heun'. This choice influences the numerical integration method applied during sampling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `eta`: Determines the step size in the numerical integration, affecting the granularity of the sampling process. A higher value indicates a larger step size. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s_noise`: Controls the level of noise introduced during the sampling process, influencing the variability of the generated samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_device`: Indicates the computational device ('gpu' or 'cpu') on which the noise generation process is executed, affecting performance and efficiency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `sampler`: The output is a sampler configured according to the specified parameters, ready for generating samples. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
