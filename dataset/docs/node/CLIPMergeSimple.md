- `CLIPMergeSimple`: This node specializes in merging two CLIP models based on a specified ratio, effectively blending their characteristics. It selectively applies patches from one model to another, excluding specific components like position IDs and logit scale, to create a hybrid model that combines features from both source models.
    - Parameters:
        - `ratio`: Determines the proportion of features from the second model to blend into the first model. A ratio of 1.0 means fully adopting the second model's features, while 0.0 retains only the first model's features. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip1`: The first CLIP model to be merged. It serves as the base model for the merging process. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `clip2`: The second CLIP model to be merged. Its key patches, except for position IDs and logit scale, are applied to the first model based on the specified ratio. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `clip`: The resulting merged CLIP model, incorporating features from both input models according to the specified ratio. Type should be `CLIP`.
