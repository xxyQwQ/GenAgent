- `RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey __Inspire`: The RetrieveBackendDataNumberKey node is designed to fetch and return data associated with a numerical key from a backend cache. It abstracts the complexity of data retrieval processes, enabling efficient access to cached data by key, and supports handling of data as lists based on the cache's content structure.
    - Parameters:
        - `key`: The 'key' parameter is a numerical identifier used to retrieve specific data from the backend cache. It plays a crucial role in accessing the desired data efficiently. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: The 'data' output represents the data retrieved from the backend cache using the numerical key. It may be returned as a single item or a list, depending on the cached content's structure. Type should be `*`.
