- `easy kSamplerSDTurbo`: The 'samplerSDTurbo' node is designed to facilitate the use of the SDTurbo sampler within a simplified interface, aiming to streamline the sampling process for users by abstracting the complexities involved in configuring and executing the SDTurbo sampling algorithm.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_output`: The 'image_output' parameter specifies the desired output format for the sampled images, offering options such as preview, save, or both. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: The 'link_id' parameter is used for tracking and linking the output within a larger system or workflow. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix`: The 'save_prefix' parameter allows users to define a prefix for saved files, facilitating organized storage of output images. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline through which data flows, serving as the conduit for input and output data during the sampling process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The 'model' parameter, marked as optional, allows for the specification of a model to be used in the sampling process, providing flexibility in choosing the underlying model for generation. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The 'pipe' output represents the processed data pipeline, encapsulating the results of the sampling operation. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The 'image' output provides the generated image, reflecting the outcome of the sampling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
