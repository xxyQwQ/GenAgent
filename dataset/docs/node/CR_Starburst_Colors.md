- `CR Starburst Colors`: The CR Starburst Colors node is designed to generate starburst patterns with alternating colors. It utilizes matplotlib to set up a plot and draw triangles in a starburst formation, allowing for customization of the number of triangles, bounding box size, and color scheme. This node is ideal for creating visually striking backgrounds or elements in graphics projects.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Sets the width of the plot area for the starburst pattern, influencing the overall size of the generated graphic. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Determines the height of the plot area, working alongside 'width' to define the dimensions of the starburst pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `num_triangles`: Specifies the number of triangles to draw in the starburst pattern, allowing for control over the pattern's complexity and density. Type should be `INT`.
        - `color_1`: Specifies the first color in the alternating color scheme of the starburst pattern. This can be a predefined color or a custom hex value if 'custom' is selected. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `color_2`: Defines the second color in the alternating color scheme, complementing the first color. Like 'color_1', it supports predefined colors or custom hex values. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `center_x`: Sets the x-coordinate of the center point for the starburst pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `center_y`: Sets the y-coordinate of the center point for the starburst pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rotation`: Determines the rotation angle of the starburst pattern, allowing for dynamic visual effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_factor`: Controls the size of the bounding box for the starburst pattern, affecting how tightly the triangles are packed together. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `color1_hex`: Specifies the hex value for the first color, used when 'color_1' is set to 'custom'. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `color2_hex`: Specifies the hex value for the second color, used when 'color_2' is set to 'custom'. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: Generates an image of the starburst pattern with the specified parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a URL to documentation or help related to the starburst pattern generation. Type should be `STRING`.
