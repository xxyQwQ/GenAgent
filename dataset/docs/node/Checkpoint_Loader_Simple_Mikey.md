- `Checkpoint Loader Simple Mikey`: This node is designed to simplify the process of loading model checkpoints for further use in machine learning tasks. It abstracts away the complexities involved in locating, loading, and configuring checkpoints, making it easier for users to integrate pre-trained models into their workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the name of the checkpoint to be loaded. This parameter is crucial as it determines which checkpoint file is accessed and loaded for use. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The loaded model object, ready for use in various machine learning tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model associated with the loaded checkpoint, if applicable and requested. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model associated with the loaded checkpoint, if applicable and requested. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `ckpt_name`: The name of the loaded checkpoint, useful for reference or further processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `ckpt_hash`: A hash value representing the loaded checkpoint, useful for verification or identification purposes. Type should be `STRING`.
