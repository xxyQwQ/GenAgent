- `Range Float`: The Range Float node generates a list of floating-point numbers within a specified range using a step value, then selects a specific number based on a seed value. This node is useful for creating sequences of numbers with precision and selecting an element from the sequence in a deterministic manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `start`: Defines the starting point of the range. It is crucial for determining the lower bound of the generated sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end`: Specifies the ending point of the range. It sets the upper limit for the sequence of numbers to be generated. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `step`: Determines the increment between each number in the range. This value affects the density and total count of numbers in the sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: Used as a basis for selecting a specific number from the generated list. It ensures a deterministic selection process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The floating-point number selected from the generated sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `string`: The string representation of the selected floating-point number. Type should be `STRING`.
