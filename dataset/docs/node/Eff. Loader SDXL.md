        - `negative`: Negative input data or conditions, used to avoid certain patterns or themes in the generated outputs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `token_normalization`: Controls the normalization of tokens, impacting the model's interpretation and processing of input data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_interpretation`: Adjusts how the model interprets the weighting of different inputs, affecting the balance between positive and negative feedback. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Specifies the width of the empty latent space, configuring the dimensions for model initialization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Defines the height of the empty latent space, setting up the spatial dimensions for the generative process. Type should be `INT`.
