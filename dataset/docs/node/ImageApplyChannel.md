- `ImageApplyChannel`: The ImageApplyChannel node is designed to modify specific color channels (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) of a collection of images by applying given channel data to them. This functionality allows for precise control over the color composition and transparency of images, enabling customized image processing and manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `channel`: Specifies which color channel (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to modify in the images. This choice dictates the aspect of the images that will be altered. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The collection of images to be modified. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base images that will undergo channel modification. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `channel_data`: The data to be applied to the specified channel of each image. This parameter directly influences the outcome by altering the specified channel's values across all images. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The modified images with the specified channel data applied. This output reflects the changes made to the original images' specified channels. Type should be `IMAGE`.
