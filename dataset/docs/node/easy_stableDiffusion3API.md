- `easy stableDiffusion3API`: This node facilitates the generation of images using the Stable Diffusion model, allowing users to specify positive and negative prompts, select a model variant, define the aspect ratio, and adjust parameters such as seed and denoise level for customized image creation.
    - Parameters:
        - `positive`: The positive prompt guides the image generation towards desired themes or elements, influencing the model's output by specifying what to include. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative`: The negative prompt steers the image generation away from certain themes or elements, helping to avoid undesired aspects in the model's output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model`: Specifies the variant of the Stable Diffusion model to be used, allowing for selection between standard and turbo modes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `aspect_ratio`: Determines the aspect ratio of the generated image, offering a range of predefined ratios to fit various needs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: Sets the seed for the random number generator, enabling reproducible results across image generations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied to the generated image, with a range from 0 (no denoise) to 1 (full denoise), affecting the clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_image`: An optional image input for tasks such as image-to-image translation or image enhancement, expanding the node's functionality. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Outputs the generated image as a result of the image generation process, encapsulating the visual representation of the input prompts and parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
