- `AnimalPosePreprocessor`: The AnimalPosePreprocessor node is designed for detecting and analyzing animal poses within images. It utilizes advanced pose estimation techniques to identify and process animal figures, aiming to provide detailed pose information that can be used for further analysis or processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `bbox_detector`: Specifies the bounding box detector model used to identify the regions of interest within the image where animals are present. This step is crucial for narrowing down the areas for pose estimation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `pose_estimator`: Defines the pose estimation model to be used for analyzing the detected animal figures within the image. This parameter determines the accuracy and effectiveness of the pose detection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resolution`: Sets the resolution for the pose detection process. Higher resolutions can lead to more detailed pose estimations but may require more computational resources. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for animal pose detection. This is the primary input for the pose estimation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Returns the processed image with detected animal poses highlighted, facilitating visual inspection and analysis of the pose estimation results. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `pose_keypoint`: Outputs the key points of detected animal poses, providing detailed information about the pose structure for further analysis or processing. Type should be `POSE_KEYPOINT`.
