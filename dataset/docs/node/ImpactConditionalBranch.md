- `ImpactConditionalBranch`: This node provides a conditional branching mechanism, allowing for the execution of different logic or values based on a given condition. It serves as a fundamental building block for creating dynamic and conditional workflows within the ImpactPack.
    - Parameters:
        - `cond`: The condition upon which the branching logic is based. It determines which of the two provided values (true or false branch) is returned by the node. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `tt_value`: The value to be returned if the condition evaluates to True. This allows for dynamic selection of output based on the condition. Type should be `*`.
        - `ff_value`: The value to be returned if the condition evaluates to False. This enables the node to selectively output values based on the evaluated condition. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `*`: The output of this node is either the tt_value or ff_value, depending on the evaluation of the condition. Type should be `*`.
