- `ColorPreprocessor`: The ColorPreprocessor node is designed to process images by detecting and annotating colors within them, utilizing a specialized color detection model. This preprocessing step is crucial for tasks that require color analysis or modification before further processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `resolution`: Specifies the resolution to which the input image should be resized before processing. This parameter influences the precision and performance of color detection. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for color detection and annotation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed image with color detection and annotation applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
