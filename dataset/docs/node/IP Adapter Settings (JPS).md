- `IP Adapter Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to configure and adapt image processing settings for various stages of image generation or manipulation. It allows for the customization of parameters such as weight, noise, start and stop points, cropping, zooming, and model selection, facilitating fine-tuned control over the image processing pipeline.
    - Parameters:
        - `ipa_weight`: Specifies the weight of the image processing adaptation, influencing the intensity of the applied settings. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_wtype`: Defines the type of weight application, such as linear or ease in-out, affecting the progression of the image processing effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ipa_noise`: Sets the noise level to be applied during the image processing, adding texture or grain as specified. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_start`: Determines the starting point of the image processing effect, allowing for precise control over when the adaptation begins. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_stop`: Defines the stopping point of the image processing effect, enabling customization of the effect's duration. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_crop`: Specifies the cropping preference, such as center or top, to adjust the focus area of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ipa_zoom`: Sets the zoom level for the image processing, allowing for closer inspection or broader views as needed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_offset_x`: Determines the horizontal offset for the image processing, enabling lateral adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ipa_offset_y`: Specifies the vertical offset for the image processing, allowing for vertical adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ipa_mask`: Defines the mask type used in the image processing, such as Mask Editor or Red from Image, to target specific areas. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `crop_intpol`: Specifies the interpolation method for cropping, affecting the smoothness or sharpness of the edges. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sharpening`: Sets the sharpening intensity, enhancing the clarity and detail of the processed image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ipa_model`: Selects the model type for the image processing, such as SDXL ViT-H, influencing the adaptation's characteristics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `ip_adapter_single_settings`: A tuple representing the configured settings for a single image processing adaptation. This output encapsulates all the necessary parameters to apply the specified image processing adjustments. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
