- `XY Input VAE`: The node is designed to facilitate the integration and manipulation of VAE (Variational Autoencoder) models within a generative art pipeline, specifically tailored for generating or transforming images based on VAE characteristics. It abstracts the complexities of handling VAE models, including loading, encoding, and decoding operations, to streamline the creation of visual content.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_mode`: Specifies the mode of input, determining whether VAE models are loaded individually or in batches, which influences how the VAE files are processed and utilized in the pipeline. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_path`: The filesystem path to a directory containing batch VAE files, used when 'input_mode' is set to batch processing, enabling the node to locate and operate on multiple VAE models. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `subdirectories`: A boolean flag indicating whether to include VAE files from subdirectories within 'batch_path' during batch processing, expanding the scope of VAE models to be considered. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `batch_sort`: Determines the order in which VAE files are processed in batch mode, supporting ascending or descending sort orders to influence the sequence of VAE model utilization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_max`: Sets a limit on the number of VAE files to be processed in batch mode, allowing for control over the maximum number of VAE models to be included in the operation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `vae_count`: Specifies the number of individual VAE models to be loaded and processed when not in batch mode, guiding the node in how many VAE models to expect and handle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `vae_name_i`: Identifies each individual VAE model by name when not using batch mode, allowing for specific VAE models to be selected and loaded for processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: The output represents either 'X' or 'Y' values processed or generated by the node, typically related to the VAE models' data or characteristics. Type should be `XY`.
