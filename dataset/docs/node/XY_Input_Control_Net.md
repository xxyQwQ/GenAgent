- `XY Input Control Net`: The node is designed to generate and manipulate XY input data for control networks, facilitating the exploration of different control parameters (such as strength, start percent, and end percent) across batches of images. It dynamically adjusts control net parameters to optimize image generation, supporting complex conditioning scenarios and enabling detailed analysis and visualization of control net effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `target_parameter`: The specific control net parameter to be varied across the batch, such as strength, start percent, or end percent, guiding the generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_count`: Specifies the number of variations to generate for the given control parameter, enabling a detailed exploration of its impact. Type should be `INT`.
        - `first_strength`: The initial strength value for the control net parameter variation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `last_strength`: The final strength value for the control net parameter variation, allowing for a range of adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `first_start_percent`: The initial start percent value for the control net parameter variation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `last_start_percent`: The final start percent value for the control net parameter variation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `first_end_percent`: The initial end percent value for the control net parameter variation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `last_end_percent`: The final end percent value for the control net parameter variation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength`: The strength level applied to the control net, affecting the intensity of its influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent`: The starting percentage of the control net's effect, determining its initial influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: The ending percentage of the control net's effect, determining its final influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `control_net`: The control network configuration to be applied or manipulated across the image batch, central to determining the influence on the generated images. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `image`: The image or batch of images to which the control net parameters are applied, serving as the basis for the control net's effect analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cnet_stack`: An optional stack of additional control net configurations, allowing for layered or sequential application of multiple control nets. Type should be `CONTROL_NET_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: The generated values for either the X or Y axis, based on the control net parameters, structured for integration into visualization or analysis tools. Type should be `XY`.
