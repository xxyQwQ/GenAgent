- `Load Cache`: The 'Load Cache' node is designed to load cached data from specified file paths. It supports loading of latent representations, images, and conditioning data, ensuring efficient reuse of previously computed or stored information. This node is essential for optimizing performance and resource utilization by avoiding redundant computations.
    - Parameters:
        - `latent_path`: Specifies the file path for the latent representation cache. If the file exists, it is loaded; otherwise, an error message is displayed. Providing a valid path allows the node to retrieve and utilize pre-computed latent representations, streamlining the workflow by bypassing the need for re-computation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_path`: Specifies the file path for the image cache. If the file exists, it is loaded; otherwise, a message is displayed. By loading an existing image from cache, this input enables the node to efficiently reuse visual data, facilitating quicker iterations and resource conservation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `conditioning_path`: Specifies the file path for the conditioning data cache. If the file exists, it is loaded; otherwise, an error message is displayed. This input is crucial for accessing pre-defined conditioning data, which can significantly impact the generation process by providing necessary context or constraints. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `LATENT`: unknown Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `IMAGE`: unknown Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `CONDITIONING`: unknown Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
