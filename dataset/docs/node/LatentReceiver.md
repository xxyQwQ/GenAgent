- `LatentReceiver`: The node 'LatentReceiver' is not explicitly defined in the provided context, indicating a potential misunderstanding or misnaming in the query. The context describes various nodes related to the manipulation and transformation of latent vectors in generative models, such as adding, subtracting, interpolating, and batch processing of latent samples. These operations are essential for advanced modifications and analyses of generated content, but do not directly relate to a 'LatentReceiver' node.
    - Parameters:
        - `latent`: This parameter represents the latent vector or representation to be received or processed by the node. Its role is crucial for the node's operation, as it directly influences the manipulation or transformation applied to the latent space. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: The 'link_id' parameter is likely intended for identifying or linking specific operations or data flows within the node's processing pipeline, although its exact purpose cannot be determined from the provided context. Type should be `INT`.
        - `trigger_always`: This parameter suggests a control mechanism for the node's operation, possibly to trigger processing under certain conditions or to ensure continuous operation. The exact functionality cannot be inferred from the provided context. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output 'latent' likely represents the transformed or manipulated latent vector resulting from the node's operation. This output is essential for further processing or analysis within the generative model's pipeline. Type should be `LATENT`.
