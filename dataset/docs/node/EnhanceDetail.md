- `EnhanceDetail`: The EnhanceDetail node is designed to improve the visual quality of images by applying a series of filters that enhance details, adjust sharpness, and potentially reduce noise. It operates by manipulating the image's details relative to its guided filter output, allowing for refined control over the enhancement process.
    - Parameters:
        - `filter_radius`: Specifies the radius of the filter applied during the enhancement process. A larger radius can lead to more pronounced detail enhancement but may also introduce more processing time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma`: Controls the sigma parameter of the guided filter, affecting the degree of smoothing and detail preservation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `denoise`: Determines the strength of the denoising filter. A higher value can reduce noise but may also diminish fine details. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `detail_mult`: A multiplier for the detail enhancement. Adjusting this value allows for fine-tuning the intensity of the detail enhancement effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be enhanced. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the enhancement process by serving as the base for all subsequent operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output of the node, which are the images after the enhancement process. These images are expected to have improved detail and potentially reduced noise. Type should be `IMAGE`.
