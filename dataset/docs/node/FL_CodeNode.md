- `FL_CodeNode`: The FL_CodeNode allows for dynamic execution of user-provided code within a predefined execution environment, enabling custom processing and manipulation of inputs to generate outputs. It abstracts the complexity of executing arbitrary code snippets safely and efficiently, providing a flexible interface for user-defined logic.
    - Parameters:
        - `code_input`: The primary input for the node, accepting a multiline string of code that the user wishes to execute. This code can interact with optional inputs and define the logic for output generation. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_i`: A series of optional input parameters (up to four) that can be used within the user-provided code for custom logic and processing. These inputs are dynamically accepted and can vary in type based on the user's code. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `output_0`: An output parameter that is the result of the executed user-provided code. Type should be `*`.
        - `output_1`: An output parameter that is the result of the executed user-provided code. Type should be `*`.
        - `output_2`: An output parameter that is the result of the executed user-provided code. Type should be `*`.
        - `output_3`: An output parameter that is the result of the executed user-provided code. Type should be `*`.
