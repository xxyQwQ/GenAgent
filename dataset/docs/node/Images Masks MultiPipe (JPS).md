- `Images Masks MultiPipe (JPS)`: The Images Masks MultiPipe node is designed to facilitate the processing and manipulation of images and masks within a pipeline, enabling operations such as generation, revision, and inpainting with the support of a model. It serves as a versatile component in workflows that require the handling of visual data and its associated masks, streamlining tasks that involve image generation, modification, and enhancement.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `generation_img`: Specifies the initial image for generation processes, setting the stage for subsequent image manipulations or enhancements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `generation_mask`: Defines the mask associated with the generation image, used for guiding or restricting certain operations within the image processing pipeline. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `ipa1_img`: Represents the first image processed through an intermediate pipeline action, contributing to the multi-step image manipulation workflow. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ipa2_img`: Denotes the second image resulting from an intermediate pipeline action, furthering the progression of image processing tasks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ipa1_mask`: Serves as the mask for the first intermediate pipeline action image, aiding in targeted image modifications or enhancements. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `ipa2_mask`: Acts as the mask for the second intermediate pipeline action image, facilitating precise control over image alterations. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `revision1_img`: Indicates the first revised image, showcasing the application of modifications or improvements post initial generation or processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `revision2_img`: Signifies the second revised image, illustrating further adjustments or refinements made after the initial set of revisions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `inpaint_model`: Incorporates a model to support inpainting tasks, enabling the restoration or completion of images based on the provided masks. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `generation_img`: Outputs the generated image after processing through the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `generation_mask`: Outputs the mask associated with the generated image, reflecting any modifications or enhancements made. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `ipa1_img`: Outputs the first intermediate processed image, after undergoing specific pipeline actions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ipa2_img`: Outputs the second intermediate processed image, showcasing further processing steps. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ipa1_mask`: Outputs the mask for the first intermediate processed image, indicating areas of focus or restriction. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `ipa2_mask`: Outputs the mask for the second intermediate processed image, guiding further image modifications. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `revision1_img`: Outputs the first revised image, after applying modifications or enhancements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `revision2_img`: Outputs the second revised image, reflecting additional adjustments or refinements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `inpaint_model`: Provides the model used for inpainting tasks, facilitating the restoration or completion of images. Type should be `MODEL`.
