- `MakeCircularVAE`: This node is designed to modify a VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to support seamless tiling in generated images, either by making a copy of the VAE or modifying it in place. It adjusts the VAE's internal model to enable or disable circular (seamless) tiling along the x-axis, y-axis, or both, based on the specified tiling mode.
    - Parameters:
        - `tiling`: Specifies the mode of tiling to be applied: enabling tiling on both axes, only on the x-axis, only on the y-axis, or disabling it. This affects how the VAE's internal model is adjusted for seamless image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `copy_vae`: Determines whether to modify the original VAE in place or to make a copy before applying the tiling modifications. This choice impacts whether the original VAE remains unchanged. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `vae`: The VAE to be modified for seamless tiling. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model that will undergo modifications to support circular tiling. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vae`: The modified VAE with seamless tiling capabilities enabled as specified. This VAE can then be used for generating images with seamless transitions. Type should be `VAE`.
