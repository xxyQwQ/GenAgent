- `CM_FloatToNumber`: This node is designed for converting floating-point values to a more general number type, facilitating operations across different numeric types by standardizing them to a common format.
    - Parameters:
        - `a`: The floating-point value to be converted into a general number type. This conversion enables seamless integration and manipulation within a broader range of mathematical operations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `number`: The result of converting the input floating-point value to a general number type, allowing for its use in a wide array of numerical computations and operations. Type should be `NUMBER`.
