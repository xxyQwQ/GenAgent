- `Batch Float Fit (mtb)`: This node is designed to adjust the range of a batch of float values, optionally clamping them within a new target range and applying an easing function for smooth transitions. It can automatically compute the source range based on the input values or use a specified range, making it versatile for various data normalization and transformation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `clamp`: A boolean indicating whether to clamp the transformed values to the target range, ensuring no values fall outside this range. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `auto_compute_source`: A boolean that, when true, automatically computes the source range from the minimum and maximum of the input values, instead of using the provided source_min and source_max. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `source_min`: The minimum value of the source range, used as the starting point for transformation if auto_compute_source is false. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `source_max`: The maximum value of the source range, used as the ending point for transformation if auto_compute_source is false. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `target_min`: The minimum value of the target range to which the input values are transformed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `target_max`: The maximum value of the target range to which the input values are transformed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `easing`: The name of the easing function to apply during the transformation, allowing for smooth transitions between ranges. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `values`: A list of float values to be transformed. The transformation adjusts these values from their original range to a new target range, potentially with clamping and easing for smooth transitions. Type should be `FLOATS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `floats`: The list of transformed float values, adjusted to the new target range with optional clamping and easing applied. Type should be `FLOATS`.
