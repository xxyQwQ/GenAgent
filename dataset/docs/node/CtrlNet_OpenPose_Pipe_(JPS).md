- `CtrlNet OpenPose Pipe (JPS)`: The CtrlNet OpenPose Pipe node is designed to process and apply OpenPose settings to input data, facilitating the configuration and application of OpenPose parameters for pose estimation tasks. It abstracts the complexity of setting up OpenPose configurations, making it easier to integrate pose estimation into broader workflows.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `openpose_settings`: Specifies the configuration settings for OpenPose, including source, strength, start, end, and options for body, face, and hand detection. Each setting plays a critical role in tailoring the OpenPose algorithm's behavior, affecting the accuracy and focus of pose estimation. For instance, the source determines where the OpenPose algorithm will be applied (e.g., main or support images), strength adjusts the intensity of pose detection, and the options for body, face, and hand detection enable specific aspects of the pose to be emphasized or ignored, depending on the requirements of the task. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `openpose_source`: Identifies the source of the input for OpenPose processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `openpose_strength`: Defines the strength of the OpenPose effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `openpose_start`: Specifies the start point of the OpenPose effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `openpose_end`: Specifies the end point of the OpenPose effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `openpose_body`: Enables or disables body detection in OpenPose. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `openpose_face`: Enables or disables face detection in OpenPose. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `openpose_hand`: Enables or disables hand detection in OpenPose. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
