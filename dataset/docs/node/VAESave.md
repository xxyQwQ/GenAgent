It encapsulates the functionality to serialize the model state and associated information into a file, facilitating the preservation and sharing of trained models.
    - Parameters:
        - `filename_prefix`: A prefix for the filename under which the model and its metadata will be saved. This allows for organized storage and easy retrieval of models. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `vae`: The VAE model to be saved. This parameter is crucial as it represents the model whose state is to be serialized and stored. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
