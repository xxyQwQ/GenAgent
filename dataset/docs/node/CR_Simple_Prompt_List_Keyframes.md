- `CR Simple Prompt List Keyframes`: This node is designed to generate a sequence of keyframes based on a list of simple prompts, intervals, and other animation parameters. It facilitates the creation of animated sequences by specifying how each prompt transitions over time, making it a crucial component for crafting dynamic visual narratives.
    - Parameters:
        - `keyframe_interval`: Specifies the interval between each keyframe in the animation, determining the pacing and length of the animated sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `loops`: Defines the number of times the animation sequence should loop, allowing for repeated cycles of the keyframe list. Type should be `INT`.
        - `transition_type`: Determines the type of transition between keyframes, affecting the animation's visual flow. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `transition_speed`: Controls the speed of transitions between keyframes, influencing the animation's tempo. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `transition_profile`: Shapes the acceleration and deceleration of transitions, adding dynamism to the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `keyframe_format`: Specifies the format for the keyframes, influencing how they are interpreted and rendered in the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `simple_prompt_list`: A list of simple text prompts that describe each keyframe. This list is the foundation for generating the animated sequence, dictating the content and order of the animation. Type should be `SIMPLE_PROMPT_LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `keyframe_list`: The generated sequence of keyframes, ready for use in creating the animated sequence. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `show_help`: A URL to documentation or help related to this node, providing additional information and guidance. Type should be `STRING`.
