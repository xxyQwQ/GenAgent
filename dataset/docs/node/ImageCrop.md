- `ImageCrop`: The ImageCrop node is designed for cropping images to a specified width and height starting from a given x and y coordinate. This functionality is essential for focusing on specific regions of an image or for adjusting the image size to meet certain requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the cropped image. This parameter determines how wide the resulting cropped image will be. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the cropped image. This parameter determines the height of the resulting cropped image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `x`: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping area. This parameter sets the starting point for the width dimension of the crop. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping area. This parameter sets the starting point for the height dimension of the crop. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be cropped. This parameter is crucial as it defines the source image from which a region will be extracted based on the specified dimensions and coordinates. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The cropped image as a result of the cropping operation. This output is significant for further processing or analysis of the specified image region. Type should be `IMAGE`.
