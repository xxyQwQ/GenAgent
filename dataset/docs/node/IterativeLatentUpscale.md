- `IterativeLatentUpscale`: The IterativeLatentUpscale node is designed to progressively upscale latent images through a series of steps, either geometrically or linearly, to achieve a desired magnification factor. This node leverages various upscaling methods and models to refine the quality of the upscaled images at each iteration, ensuring enhanced detail and resolution.
    - Parameters:
        - `upscale_factor`: The target magnification factor by which the latent samples are to be upscaled. This factor determines the final size of the upscaled images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `steps`: The number of iterative steps to perform during the upscaling process. This parameter controls the granularity of the upscaling, affecting the intermediate sizes and quality. Type should be `INT`.
        - `temp_prefix`: An optional prefix for temporary file saving during the upscaling process, facilitating intermediate result inspection. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `step_mode`: Determines whether the upscaling factor is applied geometrically or linearly across the steps, influencing the progression of image sizes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples`: The initial latent samples to be upscaled. This input is crucial as it serves as the starting point for the iterative upscaling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `upscaler`: The upscaling model or method used to enhance the resolution and detail of the latent images during each iterative step. Type should be `UPSCALER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The final upscaled latent representation after completing all iterative steps. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model used for encoding and decoding during the upscaling process, integral to the transformation of latent representations. Type should be `VAE`.
