- `CR Conditioning Mixer`: The CR Conditioning Mixer node is designed to blend or combine different conditioning inputs into a single, cohesive output. It supports various mixing methods such as combining, averaging, or concatenating conditioning inputs, allowing for flexible manipulation of conditioning data.
    - Parameters:
        - `mix_method`: Specifies the method used for mixing the conditioning inputs. It affects how the inputs are blended together, offering options like 'Combine', 'Average', or 'Concatenate'. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `average_strength`: Determines the strength or weight of the second set of conditioning inputs when using the 'Average' mixing method. It controls the balance between the two sets of inputs. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning_1`: The first set of conditioning inputs to be mixed. It serves as a base or starting point for the mixing process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `conditioning_2`: The second set of conditioning inputs to be mixed with the first set. It adds or modifies the initial conditioning based on the mixing method. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONDITIONING`: The result of mixing the conditioning inputs according to the specified method. It represents the blended conditioning data. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a URL to a help page with more information about the CR Conditioning Mixer node and its usage. Type should be `STRING`.
