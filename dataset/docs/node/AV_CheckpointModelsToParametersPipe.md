- `AV_CheckpointModelsToParametersPipe`: This node is designed to convert model checkpoint names and various model component names into a structured pipeline configuration. It facilitates the organization and management of model components such as VAEs, upscalers, and LoRA layers by mapping their names to a pipeline dictionary, streamlining the process of configuring and utilizing these components in AI art generation workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The name of the primary model checkpoint. It is crucial for identifying the main model to be used in the pipeline. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `secondary_ckpt_name`: The name of the secondary model checkpoint, allowing for the integration of additional models into the pipeline. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name`: Specifies the name of the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) model to be included in the pipeline, enhancing the model's capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `upscaler_name`: The name of the upscaling model to be used for enhancing image resolution within the pipeline. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `secondary_upscaler_name`: The name of an additional upscaling model, offering flexibility in choosing resolution enhancement methods. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_i_name`: The name of a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) layer, enabling fine-tuning of the model's behavior. The index 'i' can range from 1 to 3, allowing for the specification of up to three different LoRA layers. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: A dictionary that may already contain some pipeline configuration, which this node will update or expand based on the provided model component names. Type should be `PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: A dictionary mapping model component names to their respective identifiers, organizing the pipeline configuration for easy access and modification. Type should be `PIPE`.
