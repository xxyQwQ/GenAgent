- `InstantID Mask Prepare Pipe (JPS)`: The InstantIDMaskPrepare_Pipe node is designed for preparing image masks with specific configurations for Instant ID generation. It processes settings to adjust image preparation parameters such as resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation, tailored for mask generation in the context of identity verification or similar applications.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `imageprepare_settings`: Specifies the settings for preparing the image mask, including resizing, cropping, padding, and interpolation details, which are crucial for the mask's final appearance and alignment. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask_type`: Indicates the type of mask generated. Type should be `INT`.
        - `resize_to`: Specifies the target size to which the image should be resized. Type should be `INT`.
        - `resize_type`: Describes the method used for resizing the image, such as cropping or stretching. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `offset_width`: The width offset applied during image preparation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `offset_height`: The height offset applied during image preparation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_left`: The amount of pixels cropped from the left side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_right`: The amount of pixels cropped from the right side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_top`: The amount of pixels cropped from the top of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_bottom`: The amount of pixels cropped from the bottom of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_left`: The amount of padding added to the left side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_right`: The amount of padding added to the right side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_top`: The amount of padding added to the top of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_bottom`: The amount of padding added to the bottom of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation`: The interpolation method used for resizing the image, affecting the image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sharpening`: The level of sharpening applied to the image, enhancing detail visibility. Type should be `FLOAT`.
